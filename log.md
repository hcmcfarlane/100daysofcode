# 100 Days Of Code Log

## Day 1: Sunday 24 April 2022

**Today’s Progress**: CSS animations with FreeCampCode for the Responsive Web Design course – applied visual design. Learnt @keyframes, and another animation-related CSS stuff

**Thoughts:** Very easy, made me feel smart :joy:

## Day 2: Monday 25 April 2022

**Today’s Progress:** First day of School of Code bootcamp! Today I learned about some advanced CSS selectors, and about working with CSS on a grid

**Thoughts:** Definitely haven't committed these to memory, but I guess don't need to. Just knowing they exist and roughly how to use them will make it possible to use them down the line.

## Day 3: Tuesday 26 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Second day of School of Code bootcamp! Today we covered some vs code basics, and some coding concepts like computational thinking, and breaking down the problem. We 'found patterns' by drawing boxes in a sort of wireframing-ish exercise on an existing webpage. Brycen and I then worked on the 'CSS Koala' challenge, which was to recreate a pure-css koala. We nailed it! I learnt slightly more about css positioning, although tbh I'm not really sure I fully get it yet. In the aftenoon, after some git basics and a lovely 30min walk, we went back to CSS Koala and Brycen and I decided to animate the shit out of it. The trick was to use a `>` in our selectors for the animation: `main > * { blah }`. 

**Thoughts:** Making our weird little psychedelic css koala was a joy. The walk was really nice too and I feel a little more refreshed than I was at this time yesterday.

## Day 4: Wednesday 27 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Day 3 of School of Code! Today we got stuck into our first touch of Javascript. I had _maybe_ seen a line or two of Javascript before today (and, fortunately, did some C back in uni), but I was coming into this pretty cold. Paired again with my code buddy Brycen, I really surprised myself by getting a lot further with our github classroom tasks than I expected! We created a webpage that returns a 'secret' after you click a button. Brycen worked on a _Super Duper_ secret button using CSS animations, while I styled the page in CSS.

**Thoughts:** More chaos! Felt a bit tired this morning when waking up, really groggy, not sure why

## Day 5: Thursday 28 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Day 4 of School of Code! Today, some more javascript, understanding objects {} and arrays []. Some things are coming back to me, like zero-indexed arrays and how to manipulate elements of an array. Also learnt some new functions, like `length`, `map` and `Math.random`. Tried again to understand CSS grids, failed. More practice needed.

**Thoughts:** Bit tired again today, but excited to be doing 'real' things with JS!
