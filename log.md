## Day 11: Wednesday 3 May 2022

**Today’s progress:** Asynchronous code in the AM to fetching from APIs in the PM... I mean, look at us go... Managed to complete the bonus tasks today on the workshop, and pretty happy with that. Learnt of the importance of `await` : ALWAYS AWAIT A PROMISE. We used the [kanye.rest](https://kanye.rest) API to pull some Kanye quotes and put them in a list, while also avoiding duplicates. I felt like the problem wasn't too difficult to solve, and this time I remembered to check if JS already had a method to do the thing I wanted to do (YES - `includes()` exists). 

**Thoughts:** Pretty happy with today's stuff, all brand new and I think I pretty much understand it.

## Day 10: Tuesday 2 May 2022

**Today’s progress:** Start of Week 2 of SOC! In the morning, we had a chat from some previous bootcampers who now work for Wise. Some great advice from them on allowing yourself to rely on your mentor; practice working well with others in a team; keep a diary/journal (or #100DaysOfCode log!) so you can look back on your progress; measure your performance by how much your are _improving_; a key transferable skill you are gaining from SOC is being able to learn; ask more questions; put the hackathon projects on your github as a mini portfolio! In class, we launched right into DOM manipulation and event listeners. From learning about the DOM before lunch to adding event listeners for clicks, keyups and changes in the afternoon, a fairly huge leap!

**Thoughts:** I kept up well with class today, but I don't feel like I'm being challenged by the content, as I'm helping my partner this week keep up to speed. I would like more opportunities to get creative and test ideas and look stuff up, but I'm trying to embrace the opportunity to consolidate what I already know by teaching someone else.

## Day 9: Monday 2 May 2022

**Today’s progress:** Another 7 kyu kata on Codewars today. Squared individual digits in a number. Not quite an hour's work but it was the long weekend :P 

**Thoughts:** Much better at breaking down the problems into smaller things

## Day 8: Sunday 1 May 2022

**Today’s progress:** Some more Codewars today. Did a few of the easier katas at 8 kyu. The one I did yesterday was 6 kyu, so these were a comparable breeze. I'm using the experience of having small, simple challenges to ensure that I'm planning for each stage. I still need to find out more about the inbuilt functions for manipulating arrays and strings. For example, I built some lovely code that looped over an array and concatted each element into a new string – I could have just used `join(" ")` ... Well, practice makes perfect.

**Thoughts:** I am clearly still at the unknown unknowns stage of Javascript. Don't even know what to look up to help me do things! Hopefully that will come with experience.

## Day 7: Saturday 30 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Started out with Codewars today. Biggest takeaway - Javascript uses `**` for exponentiation, not `^` ...  _\*\*cries in maths assumptions\*\*_

**Thoughts:** You know what they say about assumptions...

## Day 6: Friday 29 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Day 5 and first hackathon with SOC. Today, tasked with creating a rock scissors paper game in the browser. There was a working product by the end, although some bits of the code were preeeeety hacky - way too much repetition instead of making neat functions, for example. I used a design generator called Neumorphism to create a sick background for our game. I also met with my mentor, Mark, who had some great advice about not getting too far ahead of myself with specialising, and just focus on learning to be a programmer. The rest will come.

**Thoughts:** Need to work on the 'making a plan' aspect of programming, so that my code is neater, scopes are clearly defined (not just making everything global and being done with it...). It's great to have a mentor, I already feel like he's got my back.

## Day 5: Thursday 28 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Day 4 of School of Code! Today, some more javascript, understanding objects {} and arrays []. Some things are coming back to me, like zero-indexed arrays and how to manipulate elements of an array. Also learnt some new functions, like `length`, `map` and `Math.random`. Tried again to understand CSS grids, failed. More practice needed.

**Thoughts:** Bit tired again today, but excited to be doing 'real' things with JS!

## Day 4: Wednesday 27 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Day 3 of School of Code! Today we got stuck into our first touch of Javascript. I had _maybe_ seen a line or two of Javascript before today (and, fortunately, did some C back in uni), but I was coming into this pretty cold. Paired again with my code buddy Brycen, I really surprised myself by getting a lot further with our github classroom tasks than I expected! We created a webpage that returns a 'secret' after you click a button. Brycen worked on a _Super Duper_ secret button using CSS animations, while I styled the page in CSS.

**Thoughts:** More chaos! Felt a bit tired this morning when waking up, really groggy, not sure why

## Day 3: Tuesday 26 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Second day of School of Code bootcamp! Today we covered some vs code basics, and some coding concepts like computational thinking, and breaking down the problem. We 'found patterns' by drawing boxes in a sort of wireframing-ish exercise on an existing webpage. Brycen and I then worked on the 'CSS Koala' challenge, which was to recreate a pure-css koala. We nailed it! I learnt slightly more about css positioning, although tbh I'm not really sure I fully get it yet. In the aftenoon, after some git basics and a lovely 30min walk, we went back to CSS Koala and Brycen and I decided to animate the shit out of it. The trick was to use a `>` in our selectors for the animation: `main > * { blah }`. 

**Thoughts:** Making our weird little psychedelic css koala was a joy. The walk was really nice too and I feel a little more refreshed than I was at this time yesterday.

## Day 2: Monday 25 April 2022

**Today’s Progress:** First day of School of Code bootcamp! Today I learned about some advanced CSS selectors, and about working with CSS on a grid

**Thoughts:** Definitely haven't committed these to memory, but I guess don't need to. Just knowing they exist and roughly how to use them will make it possible to use them down the line.

## Day 1: Sunday 24 April 2022

**Today’s Progress**: CSS animations with FreeCampCode for the Responsive Web Design course – applied visual design. Learnt @keyframes, and another animation-related CSS stuff

**Thoughts:** Very easy, made me feel smart :joy:
