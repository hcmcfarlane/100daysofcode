# 100 Days Of Code Log

## Day 1: Sunday 24 April 2022

**Today’s Progress**: CSS animations with FreeCampCode for the Responsive Web Design course – applied visual design. Learnt @keyframes, and another animation-related CSS stuff

**Thoughts:** Very easy, made me feel smart :joy:

## Day 2: Monday 25 April 2022

**Today’s Progress:** First day of School of Code bootcamp! Today I learned about some advanced CSS selectors, and about working with CSS on a grid

**Thoughts:** Definitely haven't committed these to memory, but I guess don't need to. Just knowing they exist and roughly how to use them will make it possible to use them down the line.
