# 100 Days Of Code Log

## Day 1: Sunday 24 April 2022

**Today’s Progress**: CSS animations with FreeCampCode for the Responsive Web Design course – applied visual design. Learnt @keyframes, and another animation-related CSS stuff

**Thoughts:** Very easy, made me feel smart :joy:

## Day 2: Monday 25 April 2022

**Today’s Progress:** First day of School of Code bootcamp! Today I learned about some advanced CSS selectors, and about working with CSS on a grid

**Thoughts:** Definitely haven't committed these to memory, but I guess don't need to. Just knowing they exist and roughly how to use them will make it possible to use them down the line.

## Day 3: Tuesday 26 April 2022

**Today’s progress:** Second day of School of Code bootcamp! Today we covered some vs code basics, and some coding concepts like computational thinking, and breaking down the problem. We 'found patterns' by drawing boxes in a sort of wireframing-ish exercise on an existing webpage. Brycen and I then worked on the 'CSS Koala' challenge, which was to recreate a pure-css koala. We nailed it! I learnt slightly more about css positioning, although tbh I'm not really sure I fully get it yet. In the aftenoon, after some git basics and a lovely 30min walk, we went back to CSS Koala and Brycen and I decided to animate the shit out of it. The trick was to use a `>` in our selectors for the animation: `main > * { blah }`. 

**Thoughts:** Making our weird little psychedelic css koala was a joy. The walk was really nice too and I feel a little more refreshed than I was at this time yesterday.
